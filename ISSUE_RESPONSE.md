### 3. Remaining Tasks - NONE ❌

#### According to README: ALL COMPLETE ✅

Based on comprehensive analysis of the README documentation, **NO remaining tasks** were identified. All promised features are implemented and functional:

- ✅ Configuration-based scraping (urls_config.json)
- ✅ Multiple URL support (10-15 pages)
- ✅ Keyword counting with area specificity
- ✅ Excel automation with dynamic columns
- ✅ Telegram notifications with summaries
- ✅ GitHub Actions automation
- ✅ Rate limiting (1s between requests)
- ✅ Error handling and logging

#### What Was Enhanced Beyond README

While reviewing the code, the following enhancements were implemented:

1. **Generic Scraper**: 
   - The original implementation had hardcoded logic for only 2 sites
   - Now supports unlimited sites via JSON configuration
   - Fully generic keyword counting in areas or whole page

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - README mentioned it but wasn't implemented
   - Now properly implemented with configurable delay

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - Added detailed inline comments throughout all files
   - Created REVIEW.md with technical analysis
   - Created USAGE_GUIDE.md with practical examples
   - Created urls_config_example.json with templates

4. **Better Error Handling**:
   - More descriptive error messages
   - Separate handling for different error types
   - Progress indicators during scraping
